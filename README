Oncall is a open source paging solution for system administrators to augment their IT monitoring tools. Introduce telecom technologies like SMS and voice to keep people who are "on call" in your it organization informed of network, systems (and anything else you can think of) in real time no matter where they are.

Key features
 * alerting via SMS and telephone
 * can be used with any existing monitoring solution
 * automatic escalation of alerts (up to 8 levels of escalation)
 * create teams which are completely separate from each other (alerts, twilio billing, phone numbers, more)
 * A single phone number to connect with the person on call
 * highly customizable to fit your alerting and escalation needs

Denpencies
 * web.py (http://webpy.org/)
 * twilio-python (https://github.com/twilio/twilio-python)
 * MySQLdb (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/)
 * Simplejson (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/)

Important Notes
 * The server you run Oncall on and the mysql server must be in the same timezone (for now)
 * This software does require the usage of Twilio (www.twilio.com). So you must setup a Twilo account.
 * Your Oncall server must be publically facing so twilio's servers can make http calls to it
 
States explained
Each user has a "state" (between 0 to 9). This state describes if they are on call, or not. If they are the primary oncall person, secondary, etc.
 0 = off call
 1 = on call, primary
 2 = on call, secondary
 n = on call, nth
 9 = team, for team alerting.
