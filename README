Oncall is paging solution for system administrators to augment their IT monitoring tools.

Denpencies
 * web.py (http://webpy.org/)
 * twilio-python (https://github.com/twilio/twilio-python)
 * MySQLdb (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/)
 * Simplejson (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/)

Important Notes
 * The server you run Oncall on and the mysql server must be in the same timezone
 * This software does require the usage of Twilio (www.twilio.com). So you must have a Twilo account.
 * Your Oncall server must be publically facing so twilio's servers can make http calls
 
States explained
Each user has a "state" (between 0 to 9). This state describes the state of their account.
 0 = off call
 1 = on call, primary
 2 = on call, secondary
 n = on call, nth
 9 = team, for team alerting.
